About Jameo Core Library
==========================

This is an open C++ library for providing core functions to general application development. We developed it primarily for
our needs. But if it will help you, you are welcome to use it and give feedback for useful improvements.

This includes the following basic data types or enhancements:

- Additional basic datatypes: string, date, file, colour, ...
- Basic linear algebra (vectors, matrices) and geometry functions
- Undo- and redo-management for app integration
- Simple XML in- and out
- Mutex and Threads
- Diff algorithm
- Addition random stuff

One of our interests in this project is the restriction to the C++ language. Unfortunately, there 
are a number of similar projects, which are a mixture of heavy dependencies and languages, which makes
it difficult to integrate them into other projects. We shall reduce external dependencies to a minimum 
and implement all needed content ourselves and here.

If bindings into other languages are desired, we will create our own repositories and collect
them here. 

In general we are looking forward to fellow contributors who will help us with this.
